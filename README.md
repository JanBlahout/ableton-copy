Live site can be found on 
https://elated-torvalds-974943.netlify.app/

Inpiration to create this project was taken from https://www.frontendpractice.com/project/ableton
Original site: https://www.ableton.com/en/about/

What I learened:
Grid
How to create a footer with only flexbox. 
Sticky navigation
Button "More +" is working and is displaying new content after click.

What is missing on site:
Website is not responsive. Website is created only for big screens. No tablet or mobile support (yet).
